# ReactStack

## Bootstrapping

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for simple public-facing websites      
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for larger scale dynamic applications     

## State Management

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is the best choice here      
[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) can be used to reduce the boiler plate.    

## Styling

[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for CSS-in-JS    
This can be used in combination with [xstyled](https://github.com/smooth-code/xstyled) to reduce bloat.   

## Navigation

[React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) is a good default     
[Reach](https://reach.tech/router) is a good alternative.    
Next.js also has it's own method for routing.

## Forms

[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for hook based form. This is often less code.     
[Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik)

## Prop Checking

[PropTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)
